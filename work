ball
    Rigidbody2D
        mass from 1 to 0.0001
        interpolate from none to interpolate
        collision detection from discrete to continuous

at some point run assets -> run api updater

consider changing y-axis input sensitivity and gravity
to high numbers s/t paddle moves instantly

consider allowing the paddles to fire freeze rays at eachother
that would temporarily parylize their opponent
or some other kind of ray that would cause the opponents position
to change in some (hopefully undersireable) way
if we did that we could call the game something cool with
battle or war in the name

consider temporary obstacles for the playing field
the could get destryed with one or more hits
think breakout rotated 90 degrees

consider making the game skinnable, allowing the user
to choose themes for the music and the grphics style
